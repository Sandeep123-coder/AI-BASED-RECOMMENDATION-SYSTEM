DESCRIPTION:

The project titled "AI-Based Recommendation System" involves building a functional recommendation engine using Java programming language and libraries such as Apache Mahout, designed specifically to suggest products or content based on user preferences and behaviors. The primary objective of this project is to develop a system that utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze user data and generate intelligent recommendations, thereby enhancing user experience by offering personalized suggestions. Recommendation systems have become an integral part of modern digital services, widely used in platforms like Amazon, Netflix, YouTube, and Spotify, to keep users engaged and drive sales or views through personalized content delivery.

In this project, we aim to create a basic but scalable recommendation engine that works on the principles of collaborative filtering or content-based filtering using tools provided by Apache Mahout, an open-source machine learning library that specializes in scalable algorithms for clustering, classification, and collaborative filtering. The deliverable includes a fully functioning Java program integrated into an IntelliJ IDEA environment, showcasing the ability to load user-item interaction datasets, process them using Mahout’s algorithms, and output relevant recommendations based on input user profiles.

To begin, we first set up the development environment by installing IntelliJ IDEA and importing necessary Java libraries and Maven dependencies, especially Apache Mahout libraries required for recommendation functionalities. We then prepare a sample dataset representing users, items, and user-item interactions such as ratings, purchases, or views. This data can be in CSV format containing columns like UserID, ItemID, and Rating. Once the dataset is ready, we load it into the Java application using file-handling mechanisms or Mahout’s built-in data model classes like FileDataModel, which help read the dataset efficiently.

The next step involves building the recommendation logic. Using Mahout’s UserBasedRecommender or ItemBasedRecommender classes, the system computes similarities between users or items using similarity metrics like Pearson Correlation, Euclidean Distance, or Cosine Similarity. Based on the computed similarities, the engine can predict how a user might rate unrated items and suggest the top-rated ones. Alternatively, a content-based approach can be implemented where the system recommends items similar to what the user has liked before, based on item features.

Throughout the process, special attention is given to optimizing the recommendation accuracy by selecting the appropriate similarity measure and tuning parameters like neighborhood size in user-based recommenders. Moreover, the Java program is designed to handle exceptions gracefully, ensure efficient memory usage, and provide a clean and user-friendly output, displaying recommended products for a given user input.

Additionally, for demonstration purposes, we may add a simple console-based user interface where users can enter their ID and receive a list of recommended items. Advanced implementations could even include real-time recommendations, scalability options using Mahout’s MapReduce integration, or hybrid approaches that combine both collaborative and content-based methods.

The final deliverable consists of the Java source code, the project setup file (such as a Maven pom.xml file listing the necessary dependencies), sample datasets for testing, and documentation explaining how to run the application. All components are neatly organized and properly commented to facilitate understanding for future improvements or scaling the project further.
